## Basics: What's a pointer?

First off, watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnXkiAKbUPg "Pointer Fun in C"). It's an animation on YouTube that really helps to grasp the concept of pointers in C.

In the file `pointers-basics.c` you will learn the basics of pointers in C. To compile the code, open the command prompt or terminal and browse to the folder where the file is located. After that, type the following command:

Now you can run the code by typing `.\basics.exe` (for Windows) in the terminal.
